## About the Kubernetes Top 10

When adopting [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io), we introduce new risks to our applications and infrastructure. The *OWASP Kubernetes Top 10* is aimed at helping security practitioners, system administrators, and software developers prioritize risks around the Kubernetes ecosystem. The Top Ten is a prioritized list of these risks. In the future we hope for this to be backed by data collected from organizations varying in maturity and complexity.

## Top 10 Kubernetes Risks - 2025

We're in the process of updating the Top 10 for 2025. To contribute please complete the Google Form below
